# CSCI 5461 Homework 2

The cell lines were derived from a set of breast tumors or normal tissue. Each of the cell
lines was exposed independently to five drugs, and the GI50 was measured. GI50 represents the
drug concentration at which growth is inhibited by 50%. The GI50 values have been – log10
transformed so higher values reflect greater sensitivity. For simplicity, in this assignment we
have binarized the drug sensitivity values such that “1” corresponds to a drug-sensitive cell line
and “0” corresponds to a drug-resistant cell line.
